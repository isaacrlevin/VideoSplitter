# Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 19, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how VideoSplitter ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use the VideoSplitter project and related services. This document is a general template and may be adapted for your specific deployment or platform.

## Information We Collect

- **Usage information:** Non-identifying analytics about how the software is used (e.g., feature usage, errors).
- **Uploaded content:** Any video, audio, or transcript files you provide while using the application. These files may contain personal data depending on their content.
- **Telemetry (optional):** If enabled, diagnostic and performance data to improve the application.

## How We Use Information

- To provide and maintain the application features.
- To process videos and generate transcripts and segments as requested by users.
- To improve the software and diagnose issues when telemetry is enabled.

## Data Storage and Retention

Uploaded media and generated transcripts are stored where the application is configured to save them (for example, a local database or cloud storage). Retention periods depend on your configuration. If you run a hosted instance, retain data only as long as necessary to provide the service unless otherwise required by law.

## Third-Party Services

The project may use third-party services (e.g., transcription or LLM providers). Those services may receive the data you submit for processing. Review the provider’s privacy policies for details about their data handling and retention practices.

## Security

We strive to follow reasonable security practices to protect your data. However, no transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you operate a hosted instance, implement appropriate access controls and encryption as needed.

## Children's Privacy

The software is not intended for use by children under the applicable age of majority. Do not upload content knowingly containing data from minors without appropriate consent.

## Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will reflect the most recent revision.

## Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, open an issue in the repository or contact the project maintainers.
